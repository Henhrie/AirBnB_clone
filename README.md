# AirBnB clone 
### This project aims to create an AirBnB-like application where users can manage different types of accommodations and rentals. The primary focus is on building the infrastructure for this application, including a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the system. The main components include classes for users, accommodations (places), bookings, and a storage system for data persistence
## Command Interpreter:
 The command interpreter, often referred to as a CLI (Command Line Interface), is a program that allows users to interact with the application by entering text-based commands. It serves as the interface between the user and the underlying application, facilitating the execution of various tasks and operations.

## Getting started:

To start the command interpreter for the AirBnB-like application, you would typically run a Python script that initializes the CLI. Here's an example of how to start it:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your project is located.

Run the Python script that initializes the command interpreter. For example, you might have a script named console.py

The command interpreter should start, and you will see a prompt waiting for your input.

## Usage:

Once the command interpreter is running, you can interact with the application by entering specific commands. The CLI provides various commands to perform actions like creating users, managing accommodations, making bookings, and more
